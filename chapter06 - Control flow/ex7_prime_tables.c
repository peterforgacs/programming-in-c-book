//Program to generate a table of prime numbers
/*
Program 6.10 has several inefficiencies. One inefficiency results from checking
even numbers. Because it is obvious that any even number greater than 2 cannot
be prime, the program could simply skip all even numbers as possible primes and
as possible divisors.The inner for loop is also inefficient because the value of p is
always divided by all values of d from 2 through pâ€“1 .This inefficiency could be
avoided by adding a test for the value of isPrime in the conditions of the for
loop. In this manner, the for loop could be set up to continue as long as no divi-
sor was found and the value of d was less than p . Modify Program 6.10 to incor-
porate these two changes.Then run the program to verify its operation. (Note: In
Chapter 7, you discover even more efficient ways of generating prime numbers.)
